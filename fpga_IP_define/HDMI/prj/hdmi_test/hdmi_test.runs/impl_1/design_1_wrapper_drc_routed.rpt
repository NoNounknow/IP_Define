2. REPORT DETAILS

REQP-1840#1 Warning
RAMB18 async control check  
The RAMB18E1 design_1_i/HDMI_TX_0/inst/Blu_Gamma_06/Post_Data_reg has an input control pin design_1_i/HDMI_TX_0/inst/Blu_Gamma_06/Post_Data_reg/RSTRAMARSTRAM (net: design_1_i/HDMI_TX_0/inst/Blu_Gamma_06/SR[0]) which is driven by a register (design_1_i/HDMI_TX_0/inst/reset_syn/reset_2_reg) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
Related violations: <none>

REQP-1840#2 Warning
RAMB18 async control check  
The RAMB18E1 design_1_i/HDMI_TX_0/inst/Blu_Gamma_06/Post_Data_reg has an input control pin design_1_i/HDMI_TX_0/inst/Blu_Gamma_06/Post_Data_reg/RSTRAMB (net: design_1_i/HDMI_TX_0/inst/Blu_Gamma_06/SR[0]) which is driven by a register (design_1_i/HDMI_TX_0/inst/reset_syn/reset_2_reg) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis.

REQP-1840#3 Warning
RAMB18 async control check  
The RAMB18E1 design_1_i/HDMI_TX_0/inst/Red_Gamma_06/Post_Data_reg has an input control pin design_1_i/HDMI_TX_0/inst/Red_Gamma_06/Post_Data_reg/RSTRAMARSTRAM (net: design_1_i/HDMI_TX_0/inst/Red_Gamma_06/SR[0]) which is driven by a register (design_1_i/HDMI_TX_0/inst/reset_syn/reset_2_reg) that has an active asychronous set or reset.

ZPS7-1#1 Warning
PS7 block required  
The PS7 cell must be used in this Zynq design in order to enable correct default configuration.
